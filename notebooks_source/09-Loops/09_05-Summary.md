## Summary

+++

Repetition structures allow the same piece of code to run multiple times. 

In this chapter, you learned how to write for loops and while loops in Python. For loops run a block of code a definite number of times. You learned how to use Python's ```range()``` function in a for loops and how to use a list or string in a for loop. A while loop runs a block of code as long as a logical condition is true. The keywords ```break``` and ```continue``` cause for and while loops to exit early. 

At the end of the chapter, you learned how to build flowcharts that describe programs with for loops and while loops.
