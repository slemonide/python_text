## Summary

+++

In this chapter, you learned about Jupyter notebooks. You learned what a Jupyter notebook is and why Jupyter notebooks are useful for problem solvers. This chapter showed how to install Jupyter notebooks on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Some specific operations with Jupiter notebooks were introduced:

 * Open a Jupyter Notebook
 * Rename a Jupyter Notebook
 * Write Python code in a Jupyter notebook code cells
 * Run Python code in a Jupyter notebook code cell
 * Write text in Jupyter notebook markdown cells
 * Use markdown syntax to produce formatted text, headings, lists, and tables
 * Save a Jupyter notebook
 * Download a Jupyter notebook in different file types

You also learned about special "magic" commands that can be used in a Jupyter notebook. The final section of the chapter detailed a couple of ways to get help when working with Jupyter notebooks.
