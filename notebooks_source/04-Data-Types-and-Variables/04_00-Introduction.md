+++

+++ {"latex": {"after_cell": "newpage"}}

This chapter is about Python data types. Python has many built-in data types such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and lists. 

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

 * Explain the difference between Python's built-in data types
 
 * Define variables with the assignment operator ```=```
 
 * Create variables with different data types

 * Use Python's ```type()``` function to determine an object's data type
 
 * Compare variables with the comparison operator ```==```
 
 * Convert variables from one data type to another
 
 * Work with integers, floats and complex numbers
 
 * Understand the boolean data type
 
 * Create and modify lists, dictionaries and tuples
 
 * Index and slice strings, lists and tuples
