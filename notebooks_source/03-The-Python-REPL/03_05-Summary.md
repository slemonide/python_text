## Summary

+++

In this chapter, you learned how to use the Python REPL, also called the Python prompt, to solve problems. You learned how to do arithmetic, powers and logarithms, trigonometry and save values to variables. Operations on strings were introduced including concatenation and comparison. In the last section of the chapter, Python's ```print()``` function was introduced.
